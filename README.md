## Build

This Boilerplate use webpack 3 to compile code.

## Installation

2. Install dependencies `yarn install` or `npm i`
3. Create a `.env` file in the root like the `.env.example` file.

---

## Install Mongodb

With Homebrew you can just run `brew install mongodb` and after `brew services start mongodb`.

---

## Raven Log

For get raven log create account here: [Sentry](https://sentry.io/)

---

## Body Whitelist

For security have add a whitelist function for your `req.body` coming from the front end. You can take a look of it in the `contants.js` file.

```js
const WHITELIST = {
  posts: {
    create: ['title', 'text'],
    update: ['title', 'text'],
  },
  users: {
    create: ['email', 'username', 'password'],
  },
};
```

---

## Pre-Commit Hook

I've add `pre-commit` and `lint-staged` for lint your code before commit. That can maybe take time :bowtie:

---

## Scripts

### DEV

```
yarn dev
```

or

```
npm run dev
```

**PS** That can crash if this is the first time but don't worry give it 2 sec the scripts gonna work. He just need to created a dist folder :) This way you have only one command to run.

### DEV-DEBUG

```
yarn dev:debug
```

or

```
npm run dev:debug
```

## Why toJSON on methods model ?

`toJSON()` help us to get only the data we want when we push the info to the client. So now we just need to put the user object in the `res.json(user)` and we received only what we want. Why `toAuthJSON()` ? Cause if we populated the post we get the `toJSON()` so the `toAuthJSON()` is the on to call on signup and login for get the token and _id.

```js
toAuthJSON() {
  return {
    _id: this._id,
    token: `JWT ${this.createToken()}`,
  };
},

toJSON() {
  return {
    _id: this._id,
    username: this.username,
  };
},
```

## For Validation on Request

I'm using Joi in this boilerplate, that make the validation really easy.

```js
export const validation = {
  create: {
    body: {
      email: Joi.string().email().required(),
      password: Joi.string().regex(/^[a-zA-Z0-9]{3,30}$/).required(),
      username: Joi.string().min(3).max(20).required(),
    },
  },
};

routes.post(
  '/signup',
  validate(UserController.validation.create),
  UserController.create,
);
```

## Seeds

For seed just run one of this following comand. This is helpful in dev for making fake user.

**This is only available in dev environment**

*You can change the number of seed by changing the number in each script inside `/scripts/seeds`*

- Seeds 10 user `yarn db:seeds-user`
- Clear user collection `yarn db:seeds-clear-user`
- Clear all collection `yarn db:seeds-clear`

Monitoring Server on `http://localhost:3000/status`

## Docker
